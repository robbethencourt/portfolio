      The admin backend we use to manage our transportation company. Redesigned
      in 2013 in an effort to make it more user friendly, and easier to add
      features to.

    <h4>Tables No More And So Much More</h4>
    <p>
      The original admin section of the Alpha Logistics web application was
      built in the late 90s and used tables for layout. While that's not ideal,
      what really was problematic was that many features had been added without
      attempts to organize them into like sections. Links were added to drop
      down menus and the users just had to know where to look. Onboarding new
      personnel was always challenging as navigating the admin site required
      trial and error.

    />
    <p>
      By the time I started work on the redesign, Smart Phones were being used
      by the staff. The ability to access data in the system while walking the
      warehouse became a feature that would give our management staff more
      granular visibility while away from their desk, but we needed to
      restructure the content and adopt a responsive design.

    <h4>Is The Driver Late? Now We Know</h4>
    <p>
      The redesign of the Routes Overview page gives the dispatcher and
      operations staff the ability to track late deliveries and short orders at
      a glance for all the drivers making deliveries. They can now more quickly
      identify, solve problems and communicate accurate information back to
      customers.

    <h4>Beyond Redesign and into SPA</h4>
    <p>
      While most of the javaScript is a mix of vanilla and jQuery, new features
      are now added with the front end functional programming language elm and
      react library. Elm's ability to drastically reduce, or all together
      eliminate runtime errors means we don't revisit shipped features for bugs
      we didn't catch in tests. Our business logic may need to be expanded or
      refined, but code that mysteriously fails on our users is no longer a
      concern. When the project allows, elm has become our go-to for frontend
      development.
