                <p class="article-h2-content">CrisisCorps was founded in 2016 in response to the tragic shootings that occurred at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, FL. The goal was to help cities mobilize response teams and volunteers in quicker, more efficient ways by being prepared before a disaster strikes.</p>

                <h4>Team Project Created at the UCF Coding Bootcamp</h4>
                <p>Team members were <a href="https://github.com/jennaroe">Jen</a>, <a href="https://github.com/emilysf">Emily</a>, <a href="https://github.com/PoffDev">Josh</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jcruey">Josh</a>, <a href="https://github.com/robbethencourt">myself</a></p>
                <p>I was responsible for the logo, ui design and development, mysql get queries, some mysql updates, and gulp, sass and handlebars integration.</p>

                <h4>Logo</h4>
                <p>We wanted a mark that could stand alone. The C provides that brand flexibility. It's inspired from a map marker. Idea being that Crisiscorps provides that marker to guide volunteers to where they are needed. The metallic blue/green was chosen to give a calm and professional look.</p>

                <h4>Website Details the Concept</h4>
                <p>The home page of the website explains the ideas behind Crisiscorps. When put into use by a city we envision the main website being a central hub of information. During non crisis times the site would encourage both volunteers to sign up, and businesses in the community to coordinate with the site administrator to coordinate donation pledges.</p>
                <p>During a crisis the site would be a primary source for information. From pre-crisis warnings in the event of hurricanes, to during and post crisis times that display information vital to the community.</p>

                <h4>A Community of Organizers and Volunteers</h4>
                <p>Two ideas that we brought to this project were to make it easier for communities to coordinate relief and volunteer efforts, and give members of the community the ability to get the word out on what was needed. Each user gets access to a Dashboard displaying all the tasks the administrator has created, and how many volunteers are still needed to reach the goals for each task. This gives users of the site the ability to reach out to their family, friends and followers on social media with specific details on volunteers are needed where.</p>

                <h4>Leverage What The Community Uses</h4>
                <p>Integrating social media into this project would be incredibly beneficial but one we didn't get to integrate in the 2 weeks we had to complete the project. Allowing quick access to volunteer needed details through social media would allow even quicker communication throughout the community.</p>
