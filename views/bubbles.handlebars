                <p>The vibrant colors give a sense of playfulness to the logo we wanted to convey in the app.</p>

                <h4>Web</h4>
                <p>Bubbles is a water tracking app bulit for Pilates Boutique. The idea was to create an enjoyable experience to a rather mundane task. Tracking your water inteake each day can be a pain, so the idea was to simply by letting users set a water bottle size and let their interactions on the site be a fun experince. The color pallet and animations help create that experince.</p>

                <h4>CSS Animations for a More Pleasant User Experience</h4>
                <p>The transitions between pages and navigation creates a fluid experience and eliminates the abrupt break traditionally found on the web when navigating from one view (or page) to another. Tracking your water intake also animates the circle by a percentage of the amount left to hydrate for the day. And, once you've reached your goal for the day, animated bubbles float up from the bottom of the screen. The hope with designing the app with animation in mind helped to create a pleasant user experience that makes the app fun to use.</p>

                <h4>With Great Power Comes Great Responsiblitiy</h4>
                <p>It can be easy to animate too many things! CSS animations are so easy to use that as a developer and designer restraint needs to be a priority. Animating between views can look great, but if your transitions are lasting even half a second, it becomes a frustrating experience for the user. Sure that first time may look cool, but after visiting the page 5 times a day (which the users would do as they track their water intake throughout the day) it would become maddening.</h4>
