                <h4>Logo</h4>
                <p>The original logo had two gradients that looked nice, but we wanted to simplify and minimize the color pallete. We also wanted branding that could easily transfer to the web.</p>

                </div>
                <h4>Web</h4>
                <p>The site needed an updated look, but also be responsive to multiple screen sizes.</p>

                <h4>Rewrite To Make Right</h4>
                <p>Along with the look of the site, all the content was updated to more clearly define the services Alpha Logistics offers. An entire rewrite was done to eliminate old information and update the content to be optimized for local searches. Call to action buttons were also strategically placed to try and get potential customer inquiries through the website. The focus was on presenting Alpha Logistics as a national carrier with a focus in the Florida market.</p>
                <h4>Facebook For Recruiting</h4>
                <p>A Facebook page was also created. The idea is to use it as a recruitment tool. Through Facebook, Alpha would create a contact list of carriers in other markets they could partner up with when a customer has a need in a region they don't currently service.</p>
