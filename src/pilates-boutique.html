      My wife's Pilates studio, and the reason I got into online design and
      development. She uses it to showcase her business and blog about fitness
      and nutrition.

    <h4>Logo</h4>
    <p>
      The new logo needed to have a more professional look, as the first one I
      made her was, well, let's just say it needed a more professional look and
      leave it at that. So a new typeface was chosen and the flower, which was a
      part of the original logo, was kept to keep brand consistency.

    <h4>Web</h4>
    <p>
      The Pilates Boutique website needed a responsive redesign, and the content
      needed better hierarchy.

    <h4>Yes, But Where's The Pricing&#33;</h4>
    <p>
      The goal of the redesign was to allow visitors easier access the content
      they were looking for. Whether that was session pricing, or contact info
      the new site needed to allow users to get to what they wanted quickly, and
      not have it be buried in drop-down menus.

    <h4>Integrating Vine - 2 Reasons</h4>
    <p>
      Michelle, my wife and the owner of Pilates Boutique, also began using Vine
      as a way to give clients access to simple Pilates moves on their own. She
      calls it Morning Pilates, and each video is a quick 6 second repetitive
      clip of an exercise someone can do on their own. The goal is to provide
      added value to current customers while giving potential customers a
      glimpse into her teaching. The quick sessions have worked to get potential
      customers to reach out and purchase Pilates sessions.
