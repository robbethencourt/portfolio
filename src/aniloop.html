    <h4>Not Just Cats</h4>
    <p>
      Animal videos are great, and so are animal gifs. But instead of just
      grabbing cat gifs to learn how to make Ajax calls on an API, I decided to
      use the list of endangered animals created by the
      <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/" target="noopener"
        >World Wildlife Federation</a
      >
      to raise awareness of which animals are considered to be most threatened.

    <h4>What Does a Javan Rhino Even Look Like</h4>
    <p>
      Many of the animals listed on the endangered list are ones I had either
      never heard of, or knew what they looked like. Using gifs helped put a
      face to the names of these animals. Hopefully it will create more empathy
      for the animals on the list.
