    <h4>Logo</h4>
    <p>A hand drawn logo that I then took into Illustrator.</p>
    <h4>Apron &amp; Business Card</h4>
    <p>
      This was a gift. I wanted her to have an apron with the company logo on
      it. Also, baking is really messy, so this keeps her clean, even if the
      rest of the kitchen is a wreck.

    <h4>Labels &amp; My Contact Info</h4>
    <p>
      The business cards are meant to attach to each baked good and can be
      written on to describe the "Delicious Treat" without having to make
      labels. It also allows her to put her contact information on each card so
      that if someone gives them as gifts to others, they know who to contact if
      they want some more!
