    <h4>T-Shirt, Menus and Tasting Cards</h4>

      The t-shirts were printed at
      <a href="http://www.motherfalconclothing.com/">Mother Falcon</a>, a great
      Orlando local custom t-shirt shop. The menus and tasting cards were
      printed at a local print shop.

    <h4>Looking At Paper Is Way More Pleasing Than Looking At Light</h4>
    <p>
      I've gotten into hand lettering. Partially to develop my drawing
      technique, and to just get away from the computer. It's great to take some
      time with a pad of paper and pencil every now and then, it seems to relax
      my eyes.
