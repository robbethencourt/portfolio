    <h4>Minimal Style</h4>
    <p>
      I wanted a minimal style for the look of the game with an emphasis on the
      word to be guessed and the letters the user has chosen. We were also
      discussing some typographic concepts during class that week which inspired
      the idea of using sans-serif typefaces as the game's theme.

    <h4>Vanilla JS</h4>
    <p>
      This project was created before we got into jQuery so it's gloriously
      vanilla, which I enjoy writing. I used document.onkeyup to capture the
      keyboard press events for the main functionality of the game. An intro to
      objects and methods was also a primary focus. Lots of fun.
    </p>
    <h4>Hangman's Sense of Impending Doom</h4>
    <p>
      I remember the sense of doom that would build when I played this game as a
      kid. Most would exaggerate the look of the hanging man. I didn't want to
      be that graphic, but still wanted to impart the tension that builds as you
      get closer to the noose.

    <p>
      I got the idea to fade in red bars across the screen as players
      incorrectly guess from
      <a
        href="https://www.google.com/search?q=red+swiss+type+posters&espv=2&biw=2182&bih=1106&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiSiYuCqqrNAhXBpx4KHcsLDaEQ_AUIBigB#tbm=isch&q=red+swiss+typography+posters"
        >red Swiss typography posters</a
      >. It works great. The bars become incrementally redder as each one
      appears building on that sense of dread.

    <h4>Warp World ?</h4>
    <p>
      secrets are fun to discover in games. So I implemented a color mode if the
      player guesses all possible words. It can take a bit to get to as the
      words are Math.floor(Math.Random())-ly generated, but the game lets you
      know how many unique words you've guessed and hints at the unlockable
      color theme to tease the player to continue playing.
