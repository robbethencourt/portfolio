      CrisisCorps was founded in 2016 in response to the tragic shootings that
      occurred at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, FL. The goal was to help
      cities mobilize response teams and volunteers in quicker, more efficient
      ways by being prepared before a disaster strikes.

    <h4>Logo</h4>
    <p>
      We wanted a mark that could stand alone. The C provides that brand
      flexibility. It's inspired from a map marker. Idea being that CrisisCorps
      provides that marker to guide volunteers to where they are needed. The
      metallic blue/green was chosen to give a calm and professional look.

    <h4>Website Details the Concept</h4>
    <p>
      The home page of the website explains the ideas behind CrisisCorps. When
      put into use by a city we envision the main website being a central hub of
      information. During non crisis times the site would encourage both
      volunteers to sign up, and businesses in the community to coordinate with
      the site administrator to coordinate donation pledges.
    </p>
    <p>
      During a crisis the site would be a primary source for information. From
      pre-crisis warnings in the event of hurricanes, to during and post crisis
      times that display information vital to the community.

    <h4>A Community of Organizers and Volunteers</h4>
    <p>
      Two ideas that we brought to this project were to make it easier for
      communities to coordinate relief and volunteer efforts, and give members
      of the community the ability to get the word out on what was needed. Each
      user gets access to a Dashboard displaying all the tasks the administrator
      has created, and how many volunteers are still needed to reach the goals
      for each task. This gives users of the site the ability to reach out to
      their family, friends and followers on social media with specific details
      on volunteers are needed where.

    <h4>Leverage What The Community Uses</h4>
    <p>
      Integrating social media into this project would be incredibly beneficial
      but one we didn't get to integrate in the 2 weeks we had to complete the
      project. Allowing quick access to volunteer needed details through social
      media would allow even quicker communication throughout the community.
