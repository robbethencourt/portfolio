    <h4>Logo</h4>
    <p>The logo is a slight adaptation of the current Rixen logo.</p>

    <h4>Web</h4>
    <p>
      The website needed a redesign and content overhaul. Primary focus was on
      showcasing the products and how to get started building a cable wake park.
    </p>
    <h4>Let's Not Reinvent The Wheel</h4>
    <p>
      The logo is very similar to the current Rixen logo. Being the only allowed
      Rixen cable park equipment resellers in the United States, it made sense
      to keep the branding consistent.
    </p>
    <h4>I Get It, Dude&#133;But Do You Have The Cash?</h4>
    <p>
      The website needed a complete overhaul as their name changed with the
      Rixen partnership. The content also needed more of a focus on the products
      and how to get started building a cable wake park. The previous site was
      geared towards wakeboarders, while this site needed to be focused on
      business entrepreneurs with an eye for extreme sports.
